Project: Coin Change

This file implements the slow coin change algorithm, using a brute-force recursive algorithm that runs in exponential time.
Using the provided example input file, inputs to the program include an array of coin values as well as a specified amount.
Output includes how many of each coin are needed to achieve the specified amount using the minimum number of coins possible.
