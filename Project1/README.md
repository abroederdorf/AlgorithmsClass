Project 1: Maximum Sum Subarray

Responsible for implementing the two enumeration algorithms with a running time of O(n^3) and O(n^2). File is the test program to 
determine how long the algorithm takes to calculate the maximum sum subarray of a randomly generated array of a specified input
size. Data calculated from test program was used to plot running time to compare with theoretical running time.
